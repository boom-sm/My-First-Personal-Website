                        I am profoundly dedicated to my aspirations of becoming a Software Engineer and am fully
                        committed to a continuous journey of self-improvement within this profession. Simultaneously, I
                        have invested the past 1.5 years diligently training as a Powerlifter and Bodybuilder, with the
                        relentless aim of enhancing both my physical prowess and aesthetic.
